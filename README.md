# Globular Particle Animation Project

Abstract:
This project demonstrates a method for modelling and animating viscous fluid using a physically-based particle simulator and
soft collisions. This project was inspired by the work presented by Gavin Miller & Andrew Pearse in Globular Dynamics: A
connected particle system for animating viscous fluids. Using the same fundamental theory, this project delves into the decisions
for variable values and results that Miller & Pearse neglect. Results are expanded to show how each variable influences
the animation. Specifically, how to make certain materials related to fluid. The simulation was constructed using C++ and
AnimTcl, and rendered using OpenGL. A Forward Euler approach with a small time step and elastic penalty collisions were
used to determine the next position of each particle. The results of this project are customizable by the user to form material that
looks like powder, liquid, or solid.
